## My Philosophy of Dog Training
My philosophy of dog training in large comes down to a very simple concept: association. This concept is simple yet extremely powerful and all encompassing. It is the top of the pyramid, the ultimate abstraction which has been governing and probably will continue to govern my training for as long as it is simply the best and most powerful idea around. 

The concept of association basically means that the dog will associate anything and everything that is happening NOW with everything else that is happening now. We are thus training the dog all the time even when we are not doing so consciously. If we are not training the dog then the environment does it. The dog is learning all the time - but we have the conscious power to alter the associations that the dog makes about any given situation to either encourage a certain behavior or deminish it or help the dog generalize a behavior. 

It is through association that we help the dog generalize as well. If we train a behavior in such a way that we intentionally swap out the parts of the sensory image that the dog is sensing in such a way that only the relevant parts remain then the dog learns to generalize because associations between relevant parts such as a command and a following behavior followed by a natural reinforcer is strengthened and the association between irrelevant parts of the sensory image is weakened because we swap them out for something new that has zero association to the situation from the start. 

It is also by association that the dog can learn to fear certain situations and to bite when we don't want the dog to bite. If we constantly bully the dog and take it's toys and take it's food then the dog learns that protecting it's toys and food is desirable and will snatch things and run away. If we instead create an association that with us close to the food the dog gets comfort (petting or just sitting and letting the dog eat it's bone on your lap or while laying on your feet) then the dog will not have a reason to run away and to protect it's food (of course if you try to snatch a bone any normal dog will growl and protect the resource - we should not be mad at the dog for what he is either).

Associations are also created with the use of tools that cause pain - such as electric collars (which are illegal now where I live). The reason this works is obviously because it is the fastest way to deter a behavior - the dog quickly associates the zap with whatever it is doing and will then avoid doing the behavior. The BIGGEST problem is that by the law of association the dog ALSO associates the zap with everything else which you may not even be aware of. So it is a very risky way to teach the dog - which CAN work exellently and quickly - but would require extreme care in order to avoid creating unintentional associations and avoidance behaviors.

Studies done in Norway have shown that dogs that are consistently trained with electric collars show fear for their handlers and are generally more hesitant in training than dogs that are trained predominantly with positive reinforcement techniqes. I have personally never had to use an electric collar, but I would not blindly discount it's effectiveness when it comes to very limited number of cases with dogs that can be a real danger to themselves or other people and where it is necessary to quickly break down an association enough to be able to use positive reinforcement to build a better alternative behavior (which would be very very hard to do without first snapping the dog out of a negative spiral). I think that electric collars, while promoted eagerly by american trainers, are a tool that is highly overrated - kindof like using a nuclear bomb when simple negotiation would work most of the time. So my strategy of training first and foremost is about learning good associations which then turn into instinctive habits (like sitting when waiting for food).
