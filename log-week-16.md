# 15 weeks old Belgian Malinois Puppy
This week is going to be a kind of pivotal week summarizing everything learned over the past 6 weeks and practicing it more consistently. It is a kind of very basic consolidation period. New routines may be introduced but they will all build on combinations of old routines and the goal will be to practice old routines thoroughly. 

# Summary of routines introduced during week 9-15
This is a summary of routines as opposed to experiences. For experiences I will add a separate section below.

* Sitting: Puppy learns how to sit down on his back feet. Most puppies almost know this from birth. 
* Lay: Laying down on the ground from standing still. 
* Watch: making eye contact upon command. 
* Come: Returning when called.
* Wait: remain in current position and wait for further instructions. If in motion forging ahead, stop and wait. 
* Go: abort wait command and go ahead and do it (ie eat your food or get out of the cage). 
* Sit-wait: sitting between handlers legs in crouching position facing away. Such as when something exciting is going on and it is necessary for the dog to stay calm. 
* Sit-stay: remaining in sitting position even when handler walks away. 
* Lay-stay: remaining laying down even when handler walks away. 
* Move-lay: laying down from motion. 
* Jump: jump up with front feet or over an object. 
* Down: get down from an object. (In swedish we use down for this and equivalent of "lay" for the english down. Again, commands used don't matter as long as they are consistently used in the same way). 
* No-jump: the dog is trained not to jump in order to greet.
* Focused-sit: sitting while making eye contact and without lifting paws to grab the treat above the nose. 
* Fetch: get the ball or frisbee and bring it back and drop it by my feet regardless of which way I'm facing. 
* Seek: find food or hidden toy. In more formal setting a toy is hidden explicitly and dog is commanded to find it. 
* Heel-sit: go into position on the left hand side and sit down facing same way as handler (just introduction to the formal position). 
* Watch-heel: focused heeling while watching a toy or making eye contact. 
* Out: let go of the tug when told. 

# Developing a training set
A training set is a sufficiently randomized set of the behaviors that need to be learned. The reason for randomizing the set is that stochastic learning decouples each routine from the rest and ensures that the dog learns each routine in isolation instead of sequences of routines. A training set is what will be used for the coming weeks to get better at each of the behaviors outlined above.
