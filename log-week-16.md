# 15 weeks old Belgian Malinois Puppy
This week is going to be a kind of pivotal week summarizing everything learned over the past 6 weeks and practicing it more consistently. It is a kind of very basic consolidation period. New routines may be introduced but they will all build on combinations of old routines and the goal will be to practice old routines thoroughly. 

This includes combining simple behaviors together to achieve slightly more complex behaviors. 

Such as learning door manners:

# Summary of routines introduced during week 9-15
This is a summary of routines as opposed to experiences. For experiences I will add a separate section below.

* Sitting: Puppy learns how to sit down on his back feet. Most puppies almost know this from birth. 
* Lay: Laying down on the ground from standing still. 
* Watch: making eye contact upon command. 
* Come: Returning when called.
* Wait: remain in current position and wait for further instructions. If in motion forging ahead, stop and wait. 
* Go: abort wait command and go ahead and do it (ie eat your food or get out of the cage). 
* Sit-wait: sitting between handlers legs in crouching position facing away. Such as when something exciting is going on and it is necessary for the dog to stay calm. 
* Sit-stay: remaining in sitting position even when handler walks away. 
* Lay-stay: remaining laying down even when handler walks away. 
* Move-lay: laying down from motion. 
* Jump: jump up with front feet or over an object. 
* Down: get down from an object. (In swedish we use down for this and equivalent of "lay" for the english down. Again, commands used don't matter as long as they are consistently used in the same way). 
* No-jump: the dog is trained not to jump in order to greet.
* Focused-sit: sitting while making eye contact and without lifting paws to grab the treat above the nose. 
* Fetch: get the ball or frisbee and bring it back and drop it by my feet regardless of which way I'm facing. 
* Seek: find food or hidden toy. In more formal setting a toy is hidden explicitly and dog is commanded to find it. 
* Heel-sit: go into position on the left hand side and sit down facing same way as handler (just introduction to the formal position). 
* Watch-heel: focused heeling while watching a toy or making eye contact. 
* Out: let go of the tug when told. 

# Goals for coming weeks
* To train high courage
* Introduce simple parts of agility course (no jumps higher than what the dog can jump up to). 
* Sporadic rewards in order to cement in the behaviors
* Perfect the Down-stay in order to make seek exercises easier
* Learn how to seek around obstacles (puppies have a hard time figuring out they have to walk around or under). 

# Introducing agility course
Agility course is really nothing more than a more formal set of obstacles where higher heights are involved and cool effects can be experienced such as the instability of the swing and going through crooked tunnels. 

Today we went to the agility course and tried all of the obstacles. Alice was able to go through the straight tunnel, struggled a little but went through the slightly crooked one. Climbed up the 'A' ramp (but not down). Climbed on top of and over the swing but got a bit frightened by the downward motion. Climbed up and over the 1m high ramp. Climbed up and froze on the 1.5m ramp yet after enough pacience by herself took one step at a time and finished it. Jumped over small 15-20cm obstacles. 

I can see right away how I should have taken her to the agility course earlier and introduced her to heights more. She is a little aware of heights after learning how to climb metal stairway - but not nearly as much as would be appropriate at this stage. 

# Introduction to protection training
I do not think that I have seen a more happy dog after she had the chance to get insanely mad at the decoy and really got to experience the situation of threat towards her and her owner, as she saw it, and to play out her role as protecting what is hers. The amount of affection she literally showered me with afterwards was insane. It was as though I was her everything and she would fight with all she has to protect what is hers.

The decoy today was Viorel Scientie. 

[![Protection work](https://img.youtube.com/vi/N9YAEax4yvk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9YAEax4yvk)

What I like most about the guy is how he is able to tailor the training to each dog individually. He never goes too far yet is able to percieve the razor edge where the dogs protection drive is the highest and from which point on it may dwindle into submission and fear. He is able to then balance on that edge and build it up gradually so the dog learns to read the situation and have 100% confidence about what it has to do to protect effectively. 

For a puppy like Alice this work is mainly focused at holding her in my arms and getting her to be angry at the decoy who is trying to attack us (but she does not know that it's a game). The scenario plays so well that she literally gets into the duality of emotions where both are polar opposites yet both have insane intensity - rage towards the decoy and love towards her owner. The obviousness of this just has to be experienced. 

Protection work has been the truly missing bit thus far and it is something that is impossible to train properly without a decoy promarily because the dog must feel that it is in the position to protect, it must be 100% certain about what it has to protect (the owner first) and it has to have 100% attention on the threat. There is no way to simulate this situation in a believable way without a skilled decoy because the owner can never play the role of the decoy and the object the dog is trying to protect. The dog would just be uncertain about what it has to protect and it's confidence would go into the mud. 

The aim of protection work is to teach the dog how to differentiate between something that is a real threat and something that isn't. With a skilled decoy this becomes possible to do and also it becomes possible to take ones relationship to ones dog to a whole new level - to let the dog experience the extremes of the emotions it is capable of experiencing. This undoubtfully produces a more balanced, stable and intelligent dog. 

# Introducing more distractions
This week I have also started to accustom her to various noises. A good source of noise is screws dropped inside a plastic bottle. This device makes a hefty amount of noise and the purpose is to gradually accustom the dog to the noise so that commands are obeyed and no fear or aggression is shown towards the noise source. Currently half intensity works for both tug play and feeding. Noise is gradually increased until the dog pays zero attention to it and is focused entirely at what it is that it should be doing. 

# Ultimate way to stop leash biting
Just teach the dog to carry a ball around everywhere! Simple :D

I use a combination of ways though. First I have a leash that is not nice to bite. It is a wire collar followed by a chain. This is not nice to bite 90% of the time. However when Alice does not get enough bite work she wants to bite pretty much everything and that includes the leash. Second way is that I teach her to walk beside me without pulling and without biting the leash. This takes time and gets better as other details get better - such as teaching her to slow down, gain pace, walk beside and pay attention to me by making eye contact. All these skills contribute to better behavior when walking on the leash. The ball also allows grabbing attention when necessary - I can show her the ball and she stares at it as though it was a cat. Then I give her the ball and she carries it around. She has become better at actually holding on to the ball so we can pretty much take our long walks with the ball in her mouth at all times with only minor messups. 

# Calming down a malinois at home - turn the lights down
Even after Alice get's a lot of physical activity - playing tug, running, jumping, fetching the ball or a frisbee - she can still arive home and just go nuts - running a marathon around all of the furniture at 30km/h. The way I calm her down involves following steps:

* Give her food and a bone after her meal
* Turn the lights down - turn them off completely if possible

If the lights are on she is wide awake and does her crazy game on the couch where she hides her treats in the couch and then barks at the couch for hiding her treats - pretty much. With lights out she instantly finds a place to lay down and sleeps. Perfect. 

# Proper technique for making game of tug fun for the dog
The game of tug stimulates the dog's prey drive which makes the dog chase the tug and hold on to it. Since tug or any other bite toy that the dog chases and holds on to in this case represents prey, the way to make the game fun for the dog and to teach the dog is to make the tug immitate prey as much as possible. This means the tug should move about like prey, when caught it should try to escape and then gradually it loses it's power and just jerks trying to escape as the dog holds on to it. Then the prey stops resisting and does not try to escape. The dog gets to think he won. 

When the tug is resisting, it is the perfect time to teach the "out" command so that the dog learns to let go of this hightly desirable object on command (and hopefully any other object it ever considers highly desirable as well). When the dog releases the tug she is rewarded by the tug again - the tug comes alive and the dog can grab it again. Psychologically this teaches the dog that it is ok to let go - she can still be confident that the prey will be hers in the end. In the end the dog can run off with the tug and feel proud of catching such a fantastic toy. 

# Introducing tracking
This week I have been introducing tracking in the following way:

* Go to a grass field where it is easy to lay a simple track without too many distractions
* Stomp out a square 60x60cm while dropping treats into it - this teaches the dog to associate smell of broken grass with treats
* Let the dog seek on command inside this square. 
* While the dog does the seeking in one square, make another one a short distance away
* Repeat a few times. 
* Make a track by stomping a line while dropping treats into it.
* Let the dog repeat this

The biggest issue so far has been her being so excited that she would skip treats on the track. We need to train this more and expand it to normal steps with treats on each step. 

# The training program
This week I put a little bit of thought into how to make the training more systematic. What is important is not so much what to train, but figuring out how to train the most important skills that the dog should have. Also a plan for evaluating the performance. IPO is great for this - but still everything takes place in small steps so having a clear picture of the end result and a plan is important. 

I will be developing the training program incrementally, in a true agile manner, just like this git repository and it will be available here:

# More habituation
Do not forget to keep the habituation going. This includes revisiting the experiences introduced during the initial socialization period of 8-12 weeks.
