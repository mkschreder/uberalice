# 15 weeks old Belgian Malinois Puppy
This week is going to be a kind of pivotal week summarizing everything learned over the past 6 weeks and practicing it more consistently. It is a kind of very basic consolidation period. New routines may be introduced but they will all build on combinations of old routines and the goal will be to practice old routines thoroughly. 

# Summary of routines introduced during week 9-15
This is a summary of routines as opposed to experiences. For experiences I will add a separate section below.

* Sitting: Puppy learns how to sit down on his back feet. Most puppies almost know this from birth. 
* Lay: Laying down on the ground from standing still. 
* Watch: making eye contact upon command. 
* Come: Returning when called.
* Wait: remain in current position and wait for further instructions. If in motion forging ahead, stop and wait. 
* Go: abort wait command and go ahead and do it (ie eat your food or get out of the cage). 
* Sit-wait: sitting between handlers legs in crouching position facing away. Such as when something exciting is going on and it is necessary for the dog to stay calm. 
* Sit-stay: remaining in sitting position even when handler walks away. 
* Lay-stay: remaining laying down even when handler walks away. 
* Move-lay: laying down from motion. 
* Jump: jump up with front feet or over an object. 
* Down: get down from an object. (In swedish we use down for this and equivalent of "lay" for the english down. Again, commands used don't matter as long as they are consistently used in the same way). 
* No-jump: the dog is trained not to jump in order to greet.
* Focused-sit: sitting while making eye contact and without lifting paws to grab the treat above the nose. 
* Fetch: get the ball or frisbee and bring it back and drop it by my feet regardless of which way I'm facing. 
* Seek: find food or hidden toy. In more formal setting a toy is hidden explicitly and dog is commanded to find it. 
* Heel-sit: go into position on the left hand side and sit down facing same way as handler (just introduction to the formal position). 
* Watch-heel: focused heeling while watching a toy or making eye contact. 
* Out: let go of the tug when told. 

# Goals for coming weeks
* To train hight courage
* Introduce simple parts of agility course (no jumps higher than what the dog can jump up to). 
* Sporadic rewards in order to cement in the behaviors
* Perfect the Down-stay in order to make seek exercises easier
* Learn how to seek around obstacles (puppies have a hard time figuring out they have to walk around or under). 

# Introducing agility course
Agility course is really nothing more than a more formal set of obstacles where higher heights are involved and cool effects can be experienced such as the instability of the swing and going through crooked tunnels. 

Today we went to the agility course and tried all of the obstacles. Alice was able to go through the straight tunnel, struggled a little but went through the slightly crooked one. Climbed up the 'A' ramp (but not down). Climbed on top of and over the swing but got a bit frightened by the downward motion. Climbed up and over the 1m high ramp. Climbed up and froze on the 1.5m ramp yet after enough pacience by herself took one step at a time and finished it. Jumped over small 15-20cm obstacles. 

I can see right away how I should have taken her to the agility course earlier and introduced her to heights more. She is a little aware of heights after learning how to climb metal stairway - but not nearly as much as would be appropriate at this stage. 

# Introducing more distractions
This week I have also started to accustom her to various noises. A good source of noise is screws dropped inside a plastic bottle. This device makes a hefty amount of noise and the purpose is to gradually accustom the dog to the noise so that commands are obeyed and no fear or aggression is shown towards the noise source. Currently half intensity works for both tug play and feeding. More than that and she starts barking at the noise source - which is not desirable.
