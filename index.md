## Alice

This is a place where I train my belgian malinois puppy and distill the knowledge that I gain about this breed as I go through the training process with this puppy from 9 weeks of age. At the moment I have not decided on the structure of this website or whether it will contain a lot of information at all, but as a start I'm putting this index page here which I will update as I fill this repository with more information.

Blah blah blah.. if you read this then you are probably viewing too far back in the git history :-)
