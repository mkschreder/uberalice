# Week 14 (13 weeks old malinois puppy)

[![Video week 14 summary](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2BvzfvtySz8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BvzfvtySz8)

This week training more on stay and wait. Specially wait is something that's extremely important to get down now because it provides a regulatory knob for the dogs drives. 

# Finding treats that the dog likes
I have finally found the perfect treats. It is a puppy kibble with zero wheat products which frankly smells like cat food but Alice goes absolutely crazy about it. She has tried all kinds of treats and what not. This kibble is the best. It is made for small dogs and the size of the pellets is very small - which is perfect. Precisely what I have been looking for. This is probably individual to the dog but the treats should be of such type that the dog goes absolutely crazy about them. Then training becomes much easier and dog enjoys the training more as well.

(I'm DONE with sausages for this... No more sausages necessary!)

# Learning the "get down from the table" command
In swedish "lay" is the usual down while "down" usually means "get down from your rear legs while counter surfing and don't get back up there again". So how to teach this "get down"? I find it easiest to teach any command after first getting a dog into a position where her drive is more compelling than anything else. So for training the "get down" command I use any ramp outside which is just high enough that the dog can not jump up on it. I would first say "jump" and the dog goes up on the ramp with forward feet. Then I put the "really good treats" (tm) on the "counter" just out of reach and teach "get down" from there. I find it useful to teach this outside of home so that when the command is used at home it really means "get down" without any doubts about it. For example I would not teach this command by putting treats on the table because I would not want to associate treats with the table. There are plenty of opportunities to use down at home but for teaching it I personally prefer the gravel boxes that are available outside (or just any bench. It's just that gravel boxes are exactly the right size and they are everywhere). 

# Playing games that stimulate pack drive
One of the best games I have been playing from the start is a game of following me around. The malinois breed is naturally very inclined to follow the owner around, so this kindof comes naturally. What I do want however is for this behavior to be consciously chosen so I reward the dog whenever she follows me around. Also I play games that generate a slight level of anxiety which can be relieved by the dog findding her way to me (reward) and getting some treats or other kind of reward (double reward). There are two varieties of this game: one where I just try to run away from her in the woods. She always follows. The second variety involves some kind of obstacle between me and her and some easy way to get to me which she has to figure out on her own if she wants her double reward (satisfaction of pack drive and getting a treat).

# Scaling larger obstacles
When it comes to obstacles I try to keep things safe but not too easy. When we are in the woods there is plenty of slopes which may be difficult for me to climb but are wasy for a dog because they have claws and weigh less. I have been training this kind of natural obstacle course with alice from the start and each week as she gets bigger, the obstacles can get bigger as well. Also I find it important to bake in some intellectual work here as well. This is like the previous pack drive exercise but a bit more physically challenging.

# Letting the dog wake you up when it's time to go pee
At this point it has made more sense to let Alice sleep through the night and wake me up when it's time to go. She is good at doing it now by weeping and jumping on me. So I wake up (what I think) is every single time she does that. So from dividing the night in two I now just let her sleep and take her out first late at night when I go to sleep (sometimes 00:30 or 1 oclock. Then I let her sleep and she wakes me up at 5:00 to go out again. So far she has been excellent at following this schedule so we naturally keep it in place until it is either proven contrary (ie she pees on the floor) or it becomes redundant (ie she sleeps through the night). 

# Meeting EVERY single dog that wants to meet
I do not believe in the advice some puppy owners get to only meet 1/10 dogs that pass by or "to only meet nice dogs". I think the dog should meet every single dog - even an angry one from 8 weeks old (ie after first vaccinations are done). The importance of this is just too much to ignore. The dogs that do this from an early age are able to keep calm when another dog comes barking and then stand their ground - which I appreciate a lot. Just like it is important to socialize a child from an early age the same is true for dogs. Letting a puppy meet as many dogs as is possible is the best strategy. However only as long as you associate the meetings with something positive - so it does require from you an ability to keep your dog calm if the other dog goes crazy and then associate your dog being calm with both security and treats. That's in my view is the perfect way to do it. 

# Sit, down, wait and look at me
This is a routine I have now started to do more and more in a variety of settings. Basically whenever it makes sense I use one of these. Particularly I want to get wait and look at me set in stone eventually because these two are so important. Wait is important whenever the dog has a drive it wants to pursue and you want to tell it that it's inappropriate and look at me is basic attention training which is a good habit to have. The perfect temperament in a dog in my opinion is when it asks for permission for everything it wants to do and yet at the same time does whatever is necessary when told to do so.
