# 11 weeks old (12th week)
This week would include second round of vaccinations and more focus on mental training. However I would still like to stray away from any kind of plan and just do non-resistance training - ie whatever the dog wants to do we train and learn how to do better. For example seeking has not been very motivational activity. Chasing a ball was. So fetching can be expanded more. Also jumping and running was quite enjoyed but in small quantities. Also the broken tooth needs some care and a watch for any kind of infection. 

At this point the dog weights slightly over 8kg and is pretty much home clean. I can even sometimes miss my alarm at night and then search for any accidents and I can not find any. I then take her out and she does her stuff in the woods. Still more training is good but I think the focus needs to shift a little to other things. 

In terms of experiences, water and escalators (as well as transparent stairways) are something to be trained more. These things in particular are not quite normalized yet. 

A very good book I highly recommend is the "[Schutzhund Obedience: Training in Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Schutzhund-Obedience-Training-Sheila-Booth/dp/0966302028/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1539074505&sr=8-3&keywords=schutzhund&dpID=21hSYmA0e2L&preST=_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)". This book is filled with good advice every sentence of the way. A booked truly packed with good advice. Get it on kindle (the link is not even any kind of affiliate link at this point. It would take me too much time to sort out the affiliate stuff and right now I would rather keep writing this post)

# Playing chase in the woods
One of the best games I play with my malinois puppy is the game of chase in the woods. This game activates the puppy both physically and mentally and is really fun to play. I call it "run through the woods like an idiot and let your Malinois chase you". I pick a track ahead of time, then go the starting line and run as fast as I can. At 11 weeks a malinois is never too far behind and I get fatigued pretty quickly when trying to run fast through the rocky terrain. It is a good workout for both me and the malinois puppy. For her it is not just a physical workout - it is a mental workout as well because in certain types of terrain she can not see me and has to find a way herself. Also sometimes she can not go the same way I go and has to find another way that she can take in order to find me. 

# Meeting other dogs: lots of them
At this point in the puppy development I try to have her meet and greet every single dog we come across (where the owner is also as open minded about it). What's most valuable is meeting dogs that can bark or get mad when another dog comes too close - this teaches the puppy to be ware. It is a horrible idea to try to pick dogs a puppy meets based on temperament or size (ie some people may think: my puppy is too small and too fragile to meet an aggressive large dog) Nothing is as good a way to extend required socialization time than avoiding experiences that can introduce the puppy to something new. Just be calm yourself and make sure that YOU can touch the other dog (ie it is not completely wacked in it's head to not allow you to pet it). If you can touch the other dog and pet it then your puppy will be less likely to try to go into protection instinct and try to protect you from it. 

# Extending raw food with raw bones
For the most part Alice has been eating raw meat byproducts - ground lungs, kidneys, intestines and other things from various animals (all from pet store). This week we have extended this with raw deer bones which are a bit larger and more difficult to chew. While puppy teeth are sharp, the jaws are not strong enough. At this age she mostly just nibbles at the bone and enjoys the challenge but is not yet able to crush it. It should be pointed out that you should never give cooked bone to a dog, but fresh bone is fine. They do not splinter like cooked bones. They are very nutritious and the puppy will eat them in due time when the puppy is physically ready for it (ie gets stronger in the jaws to crush the larger bones). When the puppy is able to crush the larger bone with it's teeth it will also be able to chew them so don't help the puppy along the way, do not break the larger bone because then they are more likely to swallow large bits of it which is not recommended. Let them return to the challenge for as long as it takes until they learn how to get to the yummy inner parts of the bone. 

# Learning attention
One of the things that I have found to be very important to focus on this week is attention. While alice has been showing attention in the videos I have posted on youtube (like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty3BHS_x648), it is not nearly as directed attention as would be important to have at this point. Attention training is something we have not been doing regularly up to this point and so this week I have started doing the exercises in a much more regular basis. The way to train attention is to hold something in your hand that the dog wants (bits of a sausage is perfect) and then hold the hand open in the dogs plain sight. If the dog attemps to grab the bit then close your hand. This is extremely frustrating for the dog and so the dog may start barking and trying to pry your hand open with it's teeth. Do not budge. The idea is that the dog will only get the treat when it responds to your call by looking you in the eyes. So what I do is show Alice the treat and then call her name. THe moment she responds by looking me in the eyes she gets the treat - otherwise the hand just closes and she is perplexed at first at what is going on. At this point she sometimes gets the idea - she will get it entirely in due time. 

# About "puppy courses" and other forms of training
Many people seem to wait with training their puppy until the puppy is 6 months old. While I do agree that it is better to wait with the really formal training until an older age, I see the idea of not training a puppy from the start as complete bs. It would be like waiting untnil a child is 6 years old before training house manners. Puppies start learning the moment they open their eyes. The initial learning is mostly taught by the environment. When a puppy sticks his nose into a thorny plant he LEARNS that a cactus is not a nose friendly plant so they do not nose it again. In the same way the puppy is able to learn a lot of other commands at a very young age. The expectations should not be too high. It should all be mostly play and exploration. Puppies need to explore what it is like to follow commands - so there is for the most part no place for corrections in such training.

# A place for corrections
Where corrections do make sense is when a puppy does something "in drive" (ie it really wants to do it and does not respond to simple 'no') which is truly dangerous to either the puppy or somebody else. I'm not going to tell you to grab the puppy by the throat or something else but use your own judgement when correcting the puppy. Corrections are necessary in such situations and are very important. The mother can sometimes bite the puppies quite hard if they do something that she does not like. It is important that a correction is short and stops the moment the puppy loses interest in whatever dangerous behavior he is into. At that point it is important to praise and reward the puppy a lot and redirect attention to something else (this is very hard to do without a correction when a puppy is in drive). 

It is only the truly bad and dangerous behavior that should be treated with a harsh correction - behaviors like biting children, you as the ownet or even eagerly trying to eat rocks that look like food. Adjust the correction and tone it down the better the puppy behaves. If force is needed it should never be damaging to the puppy in any way. It should be uncomfortable, submission inducing, sudden and only as long in duration as absolutely necessary. 

In fact corrections are the last resort and attention trainig does help a bit - but unfortunately some behaviors truly deserve to be eliminated and in such cases it is very important to show the dog that the behavior is truly and absolutely not ok to do. An association between such behavior and a correction is a good way to achieve this (a redirection of attention only redirects attention but fails to address the original behavior - do not hope that dog will simply lose interest in the dangerious behavior do something about it). 

# Key experiences from week 11
