# Week 11
This week would include second round of vaccinations and more focus on mental training. However I would still like to stray away from any kind of plan and just do non-resistance training - ie whatever the dog wants to do we train and learn how to do better. For example seeking has not been very motivational activity. Chasing a ball was. So fetching can be expanded more. Also jumping and running was quite enjoyed but in small quantities. Also the broken tooth needs some care and a watch for any kind of infection. 

At this point the dog weights slightly over 8kg and is pretty much home clean. I can even sometimes miss my alarm at night and then search for any accidents and I can not find any. I then take her out and she does her stuff in the woods. Still more training is good but I think the focus needs to shift a little to other things. 

In terms of experiences, water and escalators (as well as transparent stairways) are something to be trained more. These things in particular are not quite normalized yet. 

# Key experiences from week 11
* Going on the escalator
* Leash training along with sit, stay and down. 
* Off-leash training including fetch and hide&seek. 
* More to come..
