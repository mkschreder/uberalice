# Training Plan
This is a training plan for training my malinois puppy which I have started putting together when she was 15 weeks old. Up to that point she was going through her socialization period where we just randomly experienced as many situations as possible learning to deal with fear, excitement and self control as we went along. 

Now that the initial socialization period is over, it is time to make a clear plan for what we are going to train from now on and how we are going to measure out progress. Ultimately IPO provides the goals for an exceptionally obedient dog that excells at search and protection under full control of her handler. However IPO competition routine in itself - designed for competition environment, does not address the randomness of training that goes into the gradual development of the dog from puppyhood. Also 99.9% of the dogs every day experience is outside of the IPO competition field. Therefore it is a good idea to now have a think about how to integrate training into the every day life such that it first and foremost creates a versatile dog that can perform every day tasks well. 

I will therefore use ideas from IPO/schutzhund but apply them as a structured training program where it is possible to track progress gradually. The training program will build upon the socialization period but improve each area in a more structured manner where the goal is no longer just the familiarization with a new experience - but learning how to excell at the given task. 

* Focus and attention
* Basic triad: sit, down, stand
* Recall and sit in front
* Article indication
* Targeting
* Heel into position and heel while walking
* Out
* Fetching
* Jumps and walls
* Basic triad in motion
* Go out and stay
* Search an area (different from tracking)

# Command summary
Commands are merely a way to communicate with a dog in the most clear and natural way where the dog can not mistake one command to another (they need to mean specific things). I have been doing the mistake during my initial training in mixing up simple commands across different situations which made Alice unsure of what was being asked of her. Come and here are two different commands for example where here can mean not just come but come and sit facing me while looking at my face. Anyway, commands themselves are not as important as consistency of using the same commands for the same situation every single time. I will outline the table of schutzhund commands and my own (Swedish) alternatives to them which I find most natural to use. 

| German | English | Swedish | Meaning
|--------|---------|---------|--------
| Achtung! | Watch | Titta | Focus on me and make eye contact. Hold until told otherwise
| Aus! | Out | Loss | Drop whatever is in your mouth immediately and wait for further instructions
| Bleib! | Stay/Wait | Vänta | Wait on the spot in whatever position you are in until told otherwise
| Bring! | Fetch | Hämta | Get the toy/ball/whatever is out in the field. 
| Fuss! | Heel | Fot | Walk to the side while making eye contact with handler
| Gib Laut! | Bark | Prata | Bark repeatedly until reward is given
| Hier | Come | Kom | Come and stop in front of me either standing or sitting down
| Hopp | Hup | Hopp | Jump over obstacle in front of you or jump up on something
| Nein | No | Nej | Stop it
| Packen | Attack | Revir | Attack the decoy 
| Pass auf | Watch | Pass på | Watch the decoy and if he moves try to stop him (guard an object)
| Pfue | Shame | Sluta | Shame on you for doing that
| Platz | Down | Ligg | Lay down and pay attention
| Revier | Hunt | Ta den | Hunt the prey and catch it
| Sitz | Sit | Sitt | Sit down and pay attention
| Such | Search | Sök | Use your nose to find the reward
| Voraus | Run out | Sprint | Run out and down at the end (or sit).

# Focus and attention
# Basic triad: sit, down, stand
# Recall and sit in front
# Article indication
# Targeting
# Heel into position and heel while walking
# Out
# Fetching
# Jumps and walls
# Basic triad in motion
# Go out and stay

# Daily workout (combining everything)
This consists of a walk down to an open area (such as a field to start with) and doing all three parts of shutzhund - obedience, tracking and some protection work (mainly as play so no real protection). No helper needed so makes the daily workout doable at any time anywhere. 

Required equipment: 
* A ball
* A tug or sleeve
* Treats (possibly cut up weiners for tracking work)

I go out to any nearby field. During the walk I train obedience - heeling during normal leash walk, sitting when meeting people and other dogs, laying down before crossing a street or going out into the open field. Attention any time. To get rid of some of the energy I play a few fetches with the ball. Run around the field, throw the ball in one direction and run in the other. Practice recall and fetch and go get it commands.

After a few fetches I sit her down and go out and lay a track. It does not really matter if the dog sees the track being layed because she will not be able to memorize it anyway. I walk a random track out in the field making sure I do not cross a previous track but walking in a random fashion. I throw a treat in the grass for each step on each treat. That way I associate the smell of steps with treats and teach the dog to track the steps to find treats. Then I go back to her and tell her to track. If there is sufficient distance between portions of the track that turn and twist, she will be able to stay on the track even when it is her first few times doing this. 

When she has completed the track, we play protection and prey game with a tug. I challenge her with it and always practice ethe out, rewarding it with giving her a new opportunity to catch the tug. If she shows desire to fight for the tug and tries to take it from me I let her do it and run off with the tug - but not every time. When she runs off and stops there looking at me I can practice more obedience by telling her to sit. If she sits then I challenge her by going closer and trying to snatch the tug from her - during this time it is nice to practice bark so she barks at me. When she does I reward her by backing off, then going in again. Then I can tell her to lay down and once she does I can give her a few treats. Then I challenge her for the tug again and if she is not quick enough I snatch it and run away. Then stop and freeze, holding the tug high - she must bark to get the tug. When she barks she gets it - eventually having to bark more than once. This is begining of bark and hold. 

The tug game is definitely the most fun to play and this can go on for hours. When we are done playing I finish off any remaining energy in her with more ball fetching - once she starts hesitating to run after the ball I know she is pretty tired so the remaining walk home removes all remaining energy. We take it easy on the way back, she gets to pee and whatever else. We go back and she gets a meal, a bone and then sleeps. 

In total the exercise takes perhaps 2-2.5 hours.
