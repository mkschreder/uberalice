# Training Plan
This is a training plan for training my malinois puppy which I have started putting together when she was 15 weeks old. Up to that point she was going through her socialization period where we just randomly experienced as many situations as possible learning to deal with fear, excitement and self control as we went along. 

Now that the initial socialization period is over, it is time to make a clear plan for what we are going to train from now on and how we are going to measure out progress. Ultimately IPO provides the goals for an exceptionally obedient dog that excells at search and protection under full control of her handler. However IPO competition routine in itself - designed for competition environment, does not address the randomness of training that goes into the gradual development of the dog from puppyhood. Also 99.9% of the dogs every day experience is outside of the IPO competition field. Therefore it is a good idea to now have a think about how to integrate training into the every day life such that it first and foremost creates a versatile dog that can perform every day tasks well. 

I will therefore use ideas from IPO/schutzhund but apply them as a structured training program where it is possible to track progress gradually. The training program will build upon the socialization period but improve each area in a more structured manner where the goal is no longer just the familiarization with a new experience - but learning how to excell at the given task. 

* Focus and attention
* Basic triad: sit, down, stand
* Recall and sit in front
* Article indication
* Targeting
* Heel into position and heel while walking
* Out
* Fetching
* Jumps and walls
* Basic triad in motion
* Go out and stay
* Search an area (different from tracking)

# Command summary
Commands are merely a way to communicate with a dog in the most clear and natural way where the dog can not mistake one command to another (they need to mean specific things). I have been doing the mistake during my initial training in mixing up simple commands across different situations which made Alice unsure of what was being asked of her. Come and here are two different commands for example where here can mean not just come but come and sit facing me while looking at my face. Anyway, commands themselves are not as important as consistency of using the same commands for the same situation every single time. I will outline the table of schutzhund commands and my own (Swedish) alternatives to them which I find most natural to use. 

| German | English | Swedish | Meaning

| Achtung! | Watch | Titta | Focus on me and make eye contact. Hold until told otherwise
| Aus! | Out | Loss | Drop whatever is in your mouth immediately and wait for further instructions
| Bleib! | Stay/Wait | Vänta | Wait on the spot in whatever position you are in until told otherwise
| Bring! | Fetch | Hämta | Get the toy/ball/whatever is out in the field. 
| Fuss! | Heel | Fot | Walk to the side while making eye contact with handler
| Gib Laut! | Bark | Prata | Bark repeatedly until reward is given
| Hier | Come | Kom | Come and stop in front of me either standing or sitting down
| Hopp | Hup | Hopp | Jump over obstacle in front of you or jump up on something
| Nein | No | Nej | Stop it
| Packen | Attack | Revir | Attack the decoy 
| Pass auf | Watch | Pass på | Watch the decoy and if he moves try to stop him (guard an object)
| Pfue | Shame | Sluta | Shame on you for doing that
| Platz | Down | Ligg | Lay down and pay attention
| Revier | Hunt | Ta den | Hunt the prey and catch it
| Sitz | Sit | Sitt | Sit down and pay attention
| Such | Search | Sök | Use your nose to find the reward
| Voraus | Run out | Sprint | Run out and down at the end (or sit).
