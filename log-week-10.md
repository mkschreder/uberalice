## Week 10

This week we continue to focus on socialization. This includes going the tube, traveling to pet store, going by car and in the car cage, climbing in the woods and potty training. 

Something new that I would like to add for this week is search training. I did a little bit of search training with Alice before but it was not nearly as much as I would like. It would be nice to do more training in finding treats in higher grass and generally learning how to continue working with the nose without seeing the treats and keep at it until more treats are found.

I really like the new collar I bought for her. It is a collar that fits perfectly on her in terms of size and does not have any "ends" of the collar sticking out. It is basically a choke collar made for a smaller kind of dog and I find it to work perfectly for all types of training. I like to nudge it sometimes to give her an idea of where I want her to go but I generally do not pull on it. Instead I pick her up. It does happen sometimes that I really have to pull on it a bit more but most of the time I let her pull and just stand still until she responds to my call and comes to me and I then reward her a lot. 

I want her to follow directions voluntarely without feeling the collar and one thing that's very good about choke collars is that they hang very losely when the dog is not pulling at them compared to the ordinary type of collars. This makes the dog hardly feel the collar when she is not trying to pull away and then promptly make her aware of the collar when she does try to pull away. Excessive pulling however is a bad behavior so it should not be encouraged in any way. This is why I only ever let her pull for a very short time before coming to her and either picking her up or nudging her in the correct direction. I do not want her to learn to enjoy the choking. That would be counter productive in every way. 

She is rather good at keeping close and following me by my side for small stretches of time. During this week I will continue to work with her on getting her to follow even better. 

# Day 1
Doing some work around the house. Generally sleeping through the most of the day. Went climbing in rainy woods several times up and down the rocky hill. Ate around 500g of raw food and then kibble. No potty accidents in the house for 24 hours. Did a bit of training walking up and down the stairs indoors and outside. Played a lot with the ball and the bite toys. Able to hold the bite and not let go for around 20s until I either tell her to let go or give in (It is my intention that the she learns to hold on until I give in because it builds an important foundation for future training)

# Day 2
Went out with the tube and trained escalators. Ate 250g of raw food at 6 in the morning and slept for almost 4 hours at the office after the first trip with bus, tube, escalators and walking through the city. Was a bit nervous throughout the whole experience but was able to walk on her own more and generally had a more exploratory attitude when going through the experience than before (during her first time I had to carry her around most of the time). 

Weight: 7.3kg

# Day 3
First thing in the morning discovering the dog hangout area nearby. This is a closed area where dogs can play. Perfect for off leash training and just getting to know how the dog will behave in an open area. It was nice to see that alice would follow me around everywhere and I tried to run away and hide behind rocks but it was to no avail. She would still sniff me out. After that, going by a construction site was a perfect opportunity to train a little low altitude jumps over slippery plastic pipes. The pipes were arranged in a circle where I could easily get into the middle and she would have no choice but try to climb over. 

# Day 4
Went for a long family walk in the woods where alice would walk short periods and then be carried around on and off. This was first walk into deeper woods which is very different environment than just going to woods close to home. Meeting several dog breeds where she sometimes would try to induce the other dog to play by running a little towards and then away only to find out that the other dog would not always want to join in. 

# Environmental desensitisation week 10
* Going on the swing (showing that sometimes things can move)
* Riding a stroller without jumping out
* Riding in a rotating swing (feeling of gravitational pull to the side, works kind of like a centrifuge at higher speeds. Absolutely new to the dog)
* Climbing over various objects like fallen trees and pipes
* Getting on a box with front feet to get a treat (read feet has not 
* Going into bathtub with slightly warm water up to neck
* Going into lake with freezing cold 6 degrees water up to neck and following me out to the beach to then be dried and tuck into a warm cloth. 
* Meeting many different kinds of dogs (alice no longer grawls at all larger breeds, only some)
* Continue going by bus, train and among lots of people. 
* Staying in a cage by herself for a 5 hours (with check ups every 2h. She mostly sleeps in the car cage)
