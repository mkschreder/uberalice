## Week 10

This week we continue to focus on socialization. This includes going the tube, traveling to pet store, going by car and in the car cage, climbing in the woods and potty training. 

Something new that I would like to add for this week is search training. I did a little bit of search training with Alice before but it was not nearly as much as I would like. It would be nice to do more training in finding treats in higher grass and generally learning how to continue working with the nose without seeing the treats and keep at it until more treats are found.

I really like the new collar I bought for her. It is a collar that fits perfectly on her in terms of size and does not have any "ends" of the collar sticking out. It is basically a choke collar made for a smaller kind of dog and I find it to work perfectly for all types of training. I like to nudge it sometimes to give her an idea of where I want her to go but I generally do not pull on it. Instead I pick her up. It does happen sometimes that I really have to pull on it a bit more but most of the time I let her pull and just stand still until she responds to my call and comes to me and I then reward her a lot. 

I want her to follow directions voluntarely without feeling the collar and one thing that's very good about choke collars is that they hang very losely when the dog is not pulling at them compared to the ordinary type of collars. This makes the dog hardly feel the collar when she is not trying to pull away and then promptly make her aware of the collar when she does try to pull away. Excessive pulling however is a bad behavior so it should not be encouraged in any way. This is why I only ever let her pull for a very short time before coming to her and either picking her up or nudging her in the correct direction. I do not want her to learn to enjoy the choking. That would be counter productive in every way. 

She is rather good at keeping close and following me by my side for small stretches of time. During this week I will continue to work with her on getting her to follow even better.
