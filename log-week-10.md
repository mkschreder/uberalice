## Week 10

This week we continue to focus on socialization. This includes going the tube, traveling to pet store, going by car and in the car cage, climbing in the woods and potty training. 

A 10 week old puppy is roughtly equal in age to a 3 year old human child. Three year olds can do a lot but mostly in small doses. And every new experience counts and makes the puppy more rounded up baby able to deal with a variety of experiences.

Something new that I would like to add for this week is search training. I did a little bit of search training with Alice before but it was not nearly as much as I would like. It would be nice to do more training in finding treats in higher grass and generally learning how to continue working with the nose without seeing the treats and keep at it until more treats are found.

I really like the new collar I bought for her. It is a collar that fits perfectly on her in terms of size and does not have any "ends" of the collar sticking out. It is basically a choke collar made for a smaller kind of dog and I find it to work perfectly for all types of training. I like to nudge it sometimes to give her an idea of where I want her to go but I generally do not pull on it. Instead I pick her up. It does happen sometimes that I really have to pull on it a bit more but most of the time I let her pull and just stand still until she responds to my call and comes to me and I then reward her a lot. 

I want her to follow directions voluntarely without feeling the collar and one thing that's very good about choke collars is that they hang very losely when the dog is not pulling at them compared to the ordinary type of collars. This makes the dog hardly feel the collar when she is not trying to pull away and then promptly make her aware of the collar when she does try to pull away. Excessive pulling however is a bad behavior so it should not be encouraged in any way. This is why I only ever let her pull for a very short time before coming to her and either picking her up or nudging her in the correct direction. I do not want her to learn to enjoy the choking. That would be counter productive in every way. 

She is rather good at keeping close and following me by my side for small stretches of time. During this week I will continue to work with her on getting her to follow even better. 

# Day 1
Doing some work around the house. Generally sleeping through the most of the day. Went climbing in rainy woods several times up and down the rocky hill. Ate around 500g of raw food and then kibble. No potty accidents in the house for 24 hours. Did a bit of training walking up and down the stairs indoors and outside. Played a lot with the ball and the bite toys. Able to hold the bite and not let go for around 20s until I either tell her to let go or give in (It is my intention that the she learns to hold on until I give in because it builds an important foundation for future training)

# Day 2
Went out with the tube and trained escalators. Ate 250g of raw food at 6 in the morning and slept for almost 4 hours at the office after the first trip with bus, tube, escalators and walking through the city. Was a bit nervous throughout the whole experience but was able to walk on her own more and generally had a more exploratory attitude when going through the experience than before (during her first time I had to carry her around most of the time). 

Weight: 7.3kg

# Day 3
First thing in the morning discovering the dog hangout area nearby. This is a closed area where dogs can play. Perfect for off leash training and just getting to know how the dog will behave in an open area. It was nice to see that alice would follow me around everywhere and I tried to run away and hide behind rocks but it was to no avail. She would still sniff me out. After that, going by a construction site was a perfect opportunity to train a little low altitude jumps over slippery plastic pipes. The pipes were arranged in a circle where I could easily get into the middle and she would have no choice but try to climb over. 

# Day 4
Went for a long family walk in the woods where alice would walk short periods and then be carried around on and off. This was first walk into deeper woods which is very different environment than just going to woods close to home. Meeting several dog breeds where she sometimes would try to induce the other dog to play by running a little towards and then away only to find out that the other dog would not always want to join in. 

# Day 5
Went to the dog playground in the dark watching people as they would pass by outside. Good training for finding way in the dark. Was a bit uncertain for the dog at first but she found her way to me anyway (I would go out and hide somewhere when her attention was on somebody passing by). The dog area is enclosed so even a puppy can be let free which is very good. This was the first day Alice started to show some of the typical malinois traits. This was the first day she would not sleep all day but eat my shoelaces during a meeting at work. She would not sleep in the evening either until she got her share of play, finding food with her nose and freerunning in the dog playground. Definitely more puzzles and games for the coming weeks. 

# Day 6
Office wide awake. Traveling by car seems to be definitely not too exciting. It was previously much more exciting to take a trip with the bus and train. After these trips she was completely tired and would sleep for 4-5 hours even though I would carry her around a lot of the time. Hiding food in inaccessible places is a very entertaining game when she is to be entertained for a while. Today she tried to lick floor in the fiberglass room. That got me really scared. It was relatively clean floor but still possibly plenty of invisible fiberglass dust there. She managed to get a few licks before the signal traveled to my brain and I picked her up as quickly as I could. Luckely no visible fiberglass cloth was anywhere around so hopefully anything she did manage to swallow will pass straight out with food. 

# Dog in the car
There is a lot of talk these days about leaving your dog in the car and this is another area where there is too much bullshit and too little common sense. The main issue is that cars get hot when it is sunny and can get really cold fast in winter. So of course extreme heat and cold are not a good environment for a dog that's sitting in one place and can neither chill itself nor warm itself up by running for example. On that I totally agree. However how hot and how cold it gets in a car depends entirely on the car you have. If you have sunscreen on all windows except the front ones then the car does not get nearly as hot as it would get if you did not have sun screen. 

So what we do instead is have a termometer in the car with two temperatures. A cheap in-out-side termometer is great. That way you can place the "outside" sensor somewhere in the shade of the dog cage and the "inside" sensor is in the termometer itself so if you mount it on the cage door such that it is visible from the outside when your dog is inside then you and any "worrying old lady" can see the state of the deal. What I have personally found is that MY car does not get overly hot even when it is sunny but not too hot outside. It can get hot in mid summer when it is 30 degrees outside and burning sun - but that is very limited to mid summer. The dog loves being in the car and sleeping in the cage so common sense basically says "go for it and keep an eye on the temperature". So common sense also says "check up on your dog and walk your dog every 2h if she sleeps in the car and also check the temperature, give the dog water and possibly food as needed". Common sense never says "never leave your dog in a parked car". So in the liberal way you should follow your common sense and only ever listen to what has good reasons to make sense. 

# Allergic children
This is one of these areas where bullshit abounds. I don't even know if allergic people, let alone children actually exist cause I've never seen one - yet it is widely accepted that they do exist - perhaps just as a joke. Anyway, while I do have total respect for situations where allergies do result in life threatening conditions where the person is unable to breathe. I have never seen such a person that had something even close to that severety level but let's still assume that they do exist. That's fine. But when some areas become off limit to somebody just because "allergic people MAY be there" no matter what level of allergy is meant by that (or even like oops I sneezed it must be an allergic reaction to your sweater) it becomes more like racism than anything else. I have yet to see an allergic child (as opposed to a perfectly healthy kid whose parents are totally convinced he is allergic). 

A good approach for such parents in order to deserve some respect is to get a diagnosis from the doctor about their kid being allergic - all signed and stamped along with what risks the allergy poses to the kid and then to paste that paper anywhere where the kid may hang out. It should be clearly apparent which child is allergic so that proper actions can be taken to avoid exposing that child to allergens. That would be totally worthy of respect and consideration. But if that is not something anyone is willing to do to ensure the good health and well-being of their child then I could start claiming that I'm allergic to communists because they cause me to feel nausious and that communists are not welcome anywhere were I may want to spend time. This would include any public areas where I have to even pass. Communists and their ideals would be not welcome - communistic shop owners would be not welcome either. That would totally be a cool thing to do on a daily basis - as a sport. 

# Environmental desensitisation week 10
* Going on the swing (showing that sometimes things can move)
* Riding a stroller without jumping out
* Riding in a rotating swing (feeling of gravitational pull to the side, works kind of like a centrifuge at higher speeds. Absolutely new to the dog)
* Climbing over various objects like fallen trees and pipes
* Getting on a box with front feet to get a treat (read feet has not 
* Going into bathtub with slightly warm water up to neck
* Going into lake with freezing cold 6 degrees water up to neck and following me out to the beach to then be dried and tuck into a warm cloth. 
* Meeting many different kinds of dogs (alice no longer grawls at all larger breeds, only some)
* Continue going by bus, train and among lots of people. 
* Staying in a cage by herself for a 5 hours (with check ups every 2h. She mostly sleeps in the car cage)
