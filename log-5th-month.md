# 4 month old Belgian Malinois puppy (5th month)
The first few weeks have been the longest. Now it's kindof got into a stage where she knows some basics but is still very much a beginner. She can do things on command - but is still very much learning. Last month I did a lot of capturing - we did capturing of barking, holding a tug in her mouth, releasing and guarding (and many more little things). She was also introduced to protection work and displayed much better confidence in the last 2 sessions than when she first started.

It is going to be interesting to see what this month will bring. I have a few ideas and things I want to train more. One of them is the response to very specific noises. Clatter sticks, beer cans with screws, plastic bottles with scrap in them. All these things are currently very stressful and it would be good to habituate the pup to these stressors such that she remains controllable when exposed to them. Thats the main goal - to retain controllability when exposed to stressors. 

# The game of association
Dogs learn by association. I have read somewhere that dogs can only experience the now and that the responses to everything that happens now are experienced by association. Whether this is true or now we can only guess - but it is certainly a plausable scenario. It can be tested in almost every aspect of dog training - we associate both rewards, punishments and withholding of rewards with a certain situation and a certain behavior. I think that taking into account the association with the full picture is very useful tool in training. The way to make the dog generalize is to practice the same behaviors in different settings so that only the behavior would get reinforced and not the setting (which changes). When a dog is rewarded for something, it then becomes more reasonable that the reward is given for the full picture of what is happening in the now - you, the weather, the ground texture, the action and position of the dog. The same then of course holds for any punishments too. It would not be surprising to find out that dogs that are punished a lot during training, experience a lot more anxiety symptoms in the presence of the handler that dogs that get punished less. 

Personally I find this way of viewing the training very empowering and so I use it during all of my training. I switch out the parts of the picture that dont matter and reinforce the behavior across many different situations. I use my voice to associate command (for the dog it is probably just a sound pattern) with behaviors that may happen automatically. I use anything that the dog wants and give access to it in order to reinforce a behavior and take it away in order to weaken the behavior. At 4 months only very few things that the dog knows really well need to be corrected - for example sit and wait are two commands that she knows really well so a surprise correction when one of these is not obeyed can be in order and improves things instead of making the dog unsure.
