# 4 month old Belgian Malinois puppy (5th month)
The first few weeks have been the longest. Now it's kindof got into a stage where she knows some basics but is still very much a beginner. She can do things on command - but is still very much learning. Last month I did a lot of capturing - we did capturing of barking, holding a tug in her mouth, releasing and guarding (and many more little things). She was also introduced to protection work and displayed much better confidence in the last 2 sessions than when she first started.

It is going to be interesting to see what this month will bring. I have a few ideas and things I want to train more. One of them is the response to very specific noises. Clatter sticks, beer cans with screws, plastic bottles with scrap in them. All these things are currently very stressful and it would be good to habituate the pup to these stressors such that she remains controllable when exposed to them. Thats the main goal - to retain controllability when exposed to stressors. 

# The game of association
Dogs learn by association. I have read somewhere that dogs can only experience the now and that the responses to everything that happens now are experienced by association. Whether this is true or now we can only guess - but it is certainly a plausable scenario. It can be tested in almost every aspect of dog training - we associate both rewards, punishments and withholding of rewards with a certain situation and a certain behavior. I think that taking into account the association with the full picture is very useful tool in training. The way to make the dog generalize is to practice the same behaviors in different settings so that only the behavior would get reinforced and not the setting (which changes). When a dog is rewarded for something, it then becomes more reasonable that the reward is given for the full picture of what is happening in the now - you, the weather, the ground texture, the action and position of the dog. The same then of course holds for any punishments too. It would not be surprising to find out that dogs that are punished a lot during training, experience a lot more anxiety symptoms in the presence of the handler that dogs that get punished less. 

Personally I find this way of viewing the training very empowering and so I use it during all of my training. I switch out the parts of the picture that dont matter and reinforce the behavior across many different situations. I use my voice to associate command (for the dog it is probably just a sound pattern) with behaviors that may happen automatically. I use anything that the dog wants and give access to it in order to reinforce a behavior and take it away in order to weaken the behavior. At 4 months only very few things that the dog knows really well need to be corrected - for example sit and wait are two commands that she knows really well so a surprise correction when one of these is not obeyed can be in order and improves things instead of making the dog unsure. 

# Dealing with stressful situations using increased exposure
Even though the initial socialization period has passed, there is still plenty of situations where the puppy can feel agitated and uncomfortable. This can be anything and for any reason. I can outline some situations and some possible reasons as well as exposure solutions: 

|Uncertainty|Reason|Solution|
|-----------|------|--------|
|Barking at baloons|A baloon exploded once or twice when the dog has tried playing with it before|Lot's of exposure to baloons but keep the baloon off the ground and closer to the ceiling where the dog can not reach it while playing with it for as long as it takes until the dog stops barking at it. Sometimes let the baloon come close to the dog, use commands to have the dog sit or down while the baloon is on the ground. Association that is being built is that baloon is not going to attack the dog.|
|Barking at wheels of a wheeled cart|Wheels move around randomly and look like small animals|Rattle the cart all the while the dog barks. Command sit or down or anything else then stop the cart when the dog is quiet.
|Barking at the porch brush|For whatever fucking reason since 9 weeks. Possibly because it looks like it has teeth.|Brush the porch and let the dog bark. Command the dog to down, give treats. 
|Barking at shaking a plastic bottle with metal scraps in it|It rattles A LOT.|Good way to desensitize the dog to rattling sounds. Reward with treats if qiet and let the dog bark if it is already doing so.|
|Nipping at people|The dog thinks they are fun.|More walks in a crouded city with a lot of people and verbal + leash corrections but only slight.|
|Dog barks at the vacuum cleaner|It seruiously does look like an animal and sounds a lot|Play a game where the vacuum cleaner brush gives out treats. Builds positive association with the vacuum cleaner. 

What all of these situations have in common is that prolonged exposure of the same intensity tends to desensitize the dog to such situations. I think it is important not to increase intensity and not to decrease it while the dog is still barking - otherwise the dog associates decreased intensity with barking and will bark more assuming it is the noise that it finds uncomfortable. In the case of the baloon for example, the dog barks because it has an experience of the baloon blowing up and startling it when it previously tried to play with it. This is a similar situation to a puppy that gets bitten by an adult dog and then experiences aggression towards other dogs because of that. Here keeping the baloon at sufficient distance to ensure that it will not explode from pawing and biting and then prolonged exposure greatly helps with normalizing the presense of a baloon and decreasing the stress response in the dog over time. 

The key when doing this kind of "exposure therapy" is to always build upon either the neutral (lack of negative events such as ensuring the baloon just doesn't suddenly explode) or the overwhelmingly positive association (preferable). As with the case of the vacuum cleaner where there is hardly any chance of any negative association happening - one can just focus on building positive association with higher value treats (chicken, ham etc or just normal treats if that is sufficient for a dog to be focused on the treats).
