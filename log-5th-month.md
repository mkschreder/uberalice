# 4 month old Belgian Malinois puppy (5th month)
The first few weeks have been the longest. Now it's kindof got into a stage where she knows some basics but is still very much a beginner. She can do things on command - but is still very much learning. Last month I did a lot of capturing - we did capturing of barking, holding a tug in her mouth, releasing and guarding (and many more little things). She was also introduced to protection work and displayed much better confidence in the last 2 sessions than when she first started.

It is going to be interesting to see what this month will bring. I have a few ideas and things I want to train more. One of them is the response to very specific noises. Clatter sticks, beer cans with screws, plastic bottles with scrap in them. All these things are currently very stressful and it would be good to habituate the pup to these stressors such that she remains controllable when exposed to them. Thats the main goal - to retain controllability when exposed to stressors.
