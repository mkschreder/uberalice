Raising A Belgian Malinois Puppy

This is a repository where I describe my experiences when rising a belgian Malinois puppy named Alice. Malinois are a pleasure to train but do require consistency and a lot of dedication from their owners. 

# My goal with all training
To produce a dog that willfully behaves exactly as desired in all situations that it can encounter during its lifetime. 

This is a rather broad goal but quite focused as well in that I do not waste time teaching things that have zero actual every day use. I focus on utility first and foremost. Teaching the dog behaviors that help it be the best it can be - every day, in every way. This means that my focus is not on "cool tricks" but rather on utility value of each behavior being taught.
