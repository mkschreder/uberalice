Raising A Belgian Malinois Puppy

This is a repository where I describe my experiences when rising a belgian Malinois puppy named Alice. Malinois are a pleasure to train but do require consistency and a lot of dedication from their owners. 

Here is a playlist of all videos linked to from this repository, week by week (first few videos are crap so skip them):

# About the malinois breed

Belgian Malinois is a working breed. This means it requires at least 4-5 hours of your time - every single day. On average that's what I find that it requires. It is good to know this because it means that you have to structure your day around this and just realize that this is a fact. This is the time required to properly exercise this breed even when it is a puppy - from day one you get it it is a 4-5 hours per day undertaking - on average. 

It is fun of course. These 4-5 hours are filled with physical exercise for you as the owner as well. You have to play tug, lay tracks (for search work), walk long distances and run around quite a bit. 

Here is a good introduction to the breed:

# My goal with all training
To produce a dog that willfully behaves exactly as desired in all situations that it can encounter during its lifetime. 

This is a rather broad goal but quite focused as well in that I do not waste time teaching things that have zero actual every day use. I focus on utility first and foremost. Teaching the dog behaviors that help it be the best it can be - every day, in every way. This means that my focus is not on "cool tricks" but rather on utility value of each behavior being taught.
