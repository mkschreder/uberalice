## Advice we do not follow

There is plenty of puppy advice from everyone. Of course as with children (and with yourself), blindly following all advice will get you nowhere. In fact, most advice given (I generally don't see myself as giving advice to anyone other than myself, but it applies to me as well) is given with a set of parameters that describe the experiences and biases of that particular person who is giving the advice.

Therefore it is always better to take advice as a source of ideas and then to follow through on the ideas that either 1) make sense to try or 2) are proven to work AND for both 3) stimulate the behaviors you want in your dog when she grows up. 

I want my dog to be:
1) athletic and strong
2) never potty anywhere close to the house, never potty on pavement, never potty in the grass right outside of the house. Never potty in anyone elses house. Basically only potty in the woods. Of course extreme exceptions are allowed but get the general idea here. 
3) to be well adjusted to a wide variety of experiences. I do not want the adult dog to be terrified of trains or of slippery surfaces or even sudden and loud sounds (will train that as well a bit later). 

So there is some forms of advice that do not mesh well with these criteria and only hinder progress. 

## 1 - potty on the potty pads

This is a rediculous idea because it teaches the dog to piss in the the house. It does not matter if she does it on pads, newspapers or other sort of soft absorbant stuff. It is still bad. It comes natural to the dog to not make their house filthy with poop and piss so the dog actually wants to go out. If the dog is then forced to find some place around the house to do it's business it only confuses the dog. The dog would only do that out of complete frustration and probably will not even understand the whole point of it.

What I do with Alice instead is always take her out after she has slept and then drank water / eaten. And also every two hours at night. I have my alarm clock set and carry her out to the same place after the same time intervals just to teach her the idea that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING withing the walls of the house is her house and not meant to serve as the toilet. 

Eventually I will move the potty times forward by half an hour until the first interval at night covers the full night (ie when the potty times are moved, eventually they become fewer and the dog can hold through the night). 

## 2 - confinement at home

This is also something that I do not like - and for similar reasons as with potty training. I want the dog to learn early that the house is the house. It is much easier to teach a puppy what is ok and what is not ok at the early age than it is to do this when the dog has grown up. I would not want to miss teaching this before 12 weeks time by putting the dog in the cage. We do enough confinement training in the car cage.

This does come with the downside of having to have total supervision of the puppy all day long. Some people can not do this due to various reasons. I think it is a golden opportunity that's being thrown away to train basic skills. Really if you get a dog (specially a dog like a Malinois) consider having her around with you everywhere you go. A dog needs structure and needs to be with her owner as much as possible. You would not leave your toddler alone at home until much later in life. The same is for a dog (like would you really lock up your toddler in a cage and go to work? Or do the same thing at night?). 

An addition to this section should also be that it is at the same time very important to take very opportunity to TEACH that confinement is ok so that the dog can be comfortable in confinement and does not bark. For this reason it is important to balance time 

## 3 - complete restriction on exercise

Exercise has a lot of positive effects for a dog. It strengthens bones, it burns calories, it sets up metabolism for athletic shape later in life. Exercise early in life is important provided that it is not over done to the extent of getting injured. This last point is perhaps the main reason for why so much blind advice is given with regards to amount of exercise that is give to the dog early in life and the restrictions that people artificially place on the amount of exercise a puppy gets every day.

Think about it for a moment: when a child is growing he or she wants to explore and move around a lot. This type of exploration teaches the child to be cool in a wide variety of situations. A child will ride threewheeler until the child gets tired. Different children will stop after different times. How much sense would it really make to restrict the amount of exercise your child gets? I remember when I was perhaps 4 or 5, my dad used to run a lot and he would take me with him running. I was completely unable to keep up with the pace so I was literally flying through the are taking huge leaps after briefly touching the ground. He would not let me jump from a 2m wall at that age and that's totally sane. But running was a lot less stressful. Sure my legs would hurt afterwards and it was probably a bit more than would be optimal - but I thank him for bringing me in shape early. 

I would not suggest forching your puppy to move. Definitely not pulling it around by the leash and forcing it to move when it does not want to. If the puppy is tired or has her itself then it will not want to move around since that would induce more pain. So if the puppy does not want to move then it is a good sign to stop. However, if the puppy is all excited and really wants to go out running or climbing then I see absolutely no reason to miss out on the opportunity to strengthen the skeleton and build some muscle with a little more exercise. The puppy is then likely to sleep a lot after a lot of motion but if the puppy then wakes up and is equally or even more excited to do more exercise then why the hell not. 

## 4 - not giving enough food to the dog even though the dog is constantly hungry

Some people think that if you give too much food to the dog it will become fat and unhealthy. This is true if the dog food given is extremely processed kibble food that dogs were never eating for hundreds of years until the dog "fast food" revolution. If the dog eats kibble all day it makes perfect sense to restrict the amount of kibble it eats because kibble contains a lot more calories per volume than any other type of natural food. It also expands in size when it gets wet and that is another reason that it is difficult for the dog to regulate intake of kibble. I mean the dog just says "you expect me to regulate amount of fast food I eat when the fast food doesn't even accurately represent it's content with it's size and it's texture?". 

With raw food it is a lot different. I can put as much raw food as I want on the plate and alice will stop eating after around the time she has had enough. And this is a really small amount right now. Sometimes even less than 250g per time. She does get treats throughout the day so naturally she eats less food during the twice a day we give her raw food. The way we feed her is twice a day raw dog food (tasty, bloody and nutritious) and then kibble and treats during the day as rewards. She also gets a little handful of kibble in the middle of the day as her lunch but the bulk of nutritional value is provided by raw food at 6 oclock in the morning and 6 oclock in the evening. Kibble is good to have during the day mainly because it is much easier to carry around in the pockets than bloody meat paste and does not start to smell terrible either. :-)
