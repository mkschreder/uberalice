# 12 weeks old malinois puppy

This week I'll be focusing on basic commands done from motion and in different environments. The last few weeks of socialization have been extremely rewarding - Alice is both completely calm around other dogs (even ones that bark), she is able to climb on transparent stairs with motivation and without fear, she can ride the train and bus without shaking and she can be very social around other people. All of this is very good for the next stages in my training of her because it now makes it possible to focus on command training in all of these various situations without restricting oneself to some specific setting.

She weighs now 9.5kg and has a better diet with larger marrow bones as complement to her ground raw diet. She also eats verious types of grass outside, carrots and cucumbers. However marrow bones are a major addition and she is only starting to be able to eat them with her teeth. It is a good way to train her jaw muscles and also for the adult teeth that should start coming pretty soon. 

# Applying reinforcement learning to dog training
A lot can be learned about dog training from the area of machine learning. Of course it only makes sense to apply machine learning to dog trainign if you know anything about machine learning beforehand. It would definitely not make sense for somebody to learn machine learning just in order to train dogs. So I'll save you time in doing so. However I will definitely be using some of the concepts in my training and this will show by a rather unusual way of training.

I have in fact already been doing this. I have been introducing the puppy to a wide variety of situations from an early age in order to "randomize" it and expand it's awareness of the learning domain. We will be later coming back to these situations but we then will not need to "learn" how to behave in these situations and can instead focus on learning how to do something else in the wide variety of settings that have already been introduced earlier. This greatly simplifies learning and is similar to domain randomization. For example when learning to sit, domain randomization means learning this in a wide variety of settings throughout which the action to be performed remains the same. We want the dog to sit, but this has to be taught from the start in about as wide varieance of situations as we can come up with - on the table, in the train, on the escalator, on the hood of your car, on the street, on the street when it is raining etc. 

Also, consistency is very important when we are doing supervised learning - ie if we reward the dog for looking at us - the more consistent we are for rewarding that behavior anywhere it happens the more the dog will look at us. We can take advantage of the fact that dog looks at us in order to reward it in a completely new situation even when we are not actively teaching it. 

Also, this means that we avoid teaching "transitionary" behavior - such as sit before down. Such logic only takes a detour in learning - even though it may seem easier to make the dog sit before teaching down. If the purpose is to teach down then the best way to do this is to teach down in a wide variety of random settings so that the dog learns down whenever asked to do it - not just from standing. This can include teaching down in shallow water, teaching it on the snow, on the pavement, on slippery ice, from sit, from stand, from laying on the side etc. Teaching down is teaching down - not sit-then-down-and-then-down-only. There is absolutely no reasonable sense in teaching transitionary behavior - it is a waste of time - time better spent going in a straing line towards the goal instead.  

# Fodax - the best dog food in sweden (b√§sta hundmaten i sverige)
We finally got our first delivery of Fodax food for alice this week. It is a 20kg package worth of raw ground mush packaged up in 1kg bags (so 20 1kg bags of ground animal leftovers that have to go in the freezer). Luckely we do have a fairly large freezer so storing this amount of dog food is not a problem. It is the only dog food Alice actually likes to eat. There are other varieties that wus out on the content - such as some kind of salmon + chicken + beef mix for puppies. It is better than the so called "beef" mix - yet still not as good as fodax. Fodax contains all kinds of organs and does not differentiate between animals. Even bones are ground up and delivered - it is actually possible to feel small bone fragments through the plastic bag when the food has been defrosted.

Fodax makes it's living delivering dog food in large quantities, in trucks that drive around the country and you have to actually drive to the drop point and pick it up. There is no store and there is no home delivery - so the prices can be very reasonable and in fact the best compared to all other options that go through a store front (whether physical or online).
