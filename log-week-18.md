# Rewarding for steps in right direction
If you watch some of my videos, you can sometimes hear me say "good girl" even though the dog did not do what it was told. But usually what it did do was something that was a small step towards what was asked. I like this because it eliminates the ambiguity for the dog on whether it is doing something right or not. I do not use it all the time - but when I see a particularly shitty performance I find it useful to just reward a little for every right step taken and then give a big reward when task is completed and leave it at that for the occasion.
