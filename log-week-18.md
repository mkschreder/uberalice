# Week 18 (17 weeks old belgian malinois puppy)

Four months of age for this puppy is just around the corner. So this will be the last week of logging weekly and from next week on it is going to be monthly.

# Rewarding for steps in right direction
If you watch some of my videos, you can sometimes hear me say "good girl" even though the dog did not do what it was told. But usually what it did do was something that was a small step towards what was asked. I like this because it eliminates the ambiguity for the dog on whether it is doing something right or not. I do not use it all the time - but when I see a particularly shitty performance I find it useful to just reward a little for every right step taken and then give a big reward when task is completed and leave it at that for the occasion. 

# Two things I keep forgetting
Train alone time and train claw clipping. These two things are just always being left for later, for when the time is not middle of the night so she can bark without waking everyone up, for when she is not revved up so she wouldn't try to attack my hands when I try clipping her claws, for when she is not sleeping.. (she is pretty much either sleeping or revved up). I really need to get these two sorted asap. 

# Training coping behaviors
An optimal coping behavior is an optimal strategy to take in a stressful situation in order to minimize the stress. This can be standing still or laying down - or to stop barking. The method by which I train this is typical operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is done by exposing a dog to an irritating stimuli and then let the dog by itself figure out a behavior that will make the dog less stressed. It is done by setting up the environment such that the only way to get some reward is to do some action which the dog has to figure out for itself. Pure operant conditioning can of course lead to any random action which satisfies the dog so we normally want to still use classical conditioning once the dog does the right action. Before we do that however, we let the dog experience a stressor without overstimulating the dog in order to promote learning of a good copins strategy. The moment the dog shows good behavior we must wait for a short while to make sure the dog is focused on the good behavior and then reward the dog. 

It is important to reward when the dog is focused on something else. I can make sure she is by using the attention command to make her look at me and be quiet. Whatever she is doing when the reward is presented will be the primary action associated with the reward - always.
