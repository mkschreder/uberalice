# Week 18 (17 weeks old belgian malinois puppy)

Four months of age for this puppy is just around the corner. So this will be the last week of logging weekly and from next week on it is going to be monthly. 

Current weight: 15.7kg

# Rewarding for steps in right direction
If you watch some of my videos, you can sometimes hear me say "good girl" even though the dog did not do what it was told. But usually what it did do was something that was a small step towards what was asked. I like this because it eliminates the ambiguity for the dog on whether it is doing something right or not. I do not use it all the time - but when I see a particularly shitty performance I find it useful to just reward a little for every right step taken and then give a big reward when task is completed and leave it at that for the occasion. 

# Two things I keep forgetting
Train alone time and train claw clipping. These two things are just always being left for later, for when the time is not middle of the night so she can bark without waking everyone up, for when she is not revved up so she wouldn't try to attack my hands when I try clipping her claws, for when she is not sleeping.. (she is pretty much either sleeping or revved up). I really need to get these two sorted asap.
