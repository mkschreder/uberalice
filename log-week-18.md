# Week 18 (17 weeks old belgian malinois puppy)

Four months of age for this puppy is just around the corner. So this will be the last week of logging weekly and from next week on it is going to be monthly. 

Current weight: 15.7kg

At this point it was a good idea to go out and refresh the early 9-10 weeks socialization period:

# Rewarding for steps in right direction
If you watch some of my videos, you can sometimes hear me say "good girl" even though the dog did not do what it was told. But usually what it did do was something that was a small step towards what was asked. I like this because it eliminates the ambiguity for the dog on whether it is doing something right or not. I do not use it all the time - but when I see a particularly shitty performance I find it useful to just reward a little for every right step taken and then give a big reward when task is completed and leave it at that for the occasion. 

# Two things I keep forgetting
Train alone time and train claw clipping. These two things are just always being left for later, for when the time is not middle of the night so she can bark without waking everyone up, for when she is not revved up so she wouldn't try to attack my hands when I try clipping her claws, for when she is not sleeping.. (she is pretty much either sleeping or revved up). I really need to get these two sorted asap.

# Training coping behaviors
An optimal coping behavior is an optimal strategy to take in a stressful situation in order to minimize the stress. This can be standing still or laying down - or to stop barking. The method by which I train this is typical operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is done by exposing a dog to an irritating stimuli and then let the dog by itself figure out a behavior that will make the dog less stressed. It is done by setting up the environment such that the only way to get some reward is to do some action which the dog has to figure out for itself. Pure operant conditioning can of course lead to any random action which satisfies the dog so we normally want to still use classical conditioning once the dog does the right action. Before we do that however, we let the dog experience a stressor without overstimulating the dog in order to promote learning of a good copins strategy. The moment the dog shows good behavior we must wait for a short while to make sure the dog is focused on the good behavior and then reward the dog. 

It is important to reward when the dog is focused on something else. I can make sure she is by using the attention command to make her look at me and be quiet. Whatever she is doing when the reward is presented will be the primary action associated with the reward - always. 

# More protection training
This week we had four sessions of prefessional decoy work and compared to her first two sessions two weeks ago this was a huge improvement. Due to her size it was practically impossible to hold her in my arms any more because she has grown. Nor was it needed. The fear that she was experiencing (on the verge of wanting to fear bite the decoy) on the first session was now replaced by solid interest, confidence and a deep bark at the decoy. She was full on, ears up, tail wagging when the decoy would come closer. This time the first two sessions she would stand on her own and bark at the decoy approaching, the decoy would then run away and pretend to be scared by her bark - which builds confidence. Session three was repetition of the previous two sessions - just building confidence barking, grawling and watching the decoy. The last session however was a group session with 4 other dogs all barking at the decoy. This was the new marking point - the new point of huge progress. No better way to build a dog's confidence than to have her watch experienced dogs do protection work. It was great.

# Muzzling up and clipping nails
These dogs learn things after 3 attempts - or at least get the idea - which is both a good thing (when training) and a bad thing (when inadvertantly turning the dog against some activity - such as clipping nails). After I happened to cut a bit too much with the nail clipper by mistake, she has associated the nail clipper with pain and so it was very hard to get her to clip nails again without growling and snapping at both my hands and the clipper. So I've had enough of that, put a muzzle on her and off we go training that clipping nails can be FUN!

Done this in 3 sessions this week. Session one was the hardest and I only got one nail clipped. During session two I clipped all back nails while she was busy eating food. In session three all front nails. The easiest way to do this was to give her some treats and then while she is trying to eat them from the floor through her muzzle, cut the nails while her feet are on the ground. With a nail clipper that has a stopping clip it is possible to ensure that one does not cut too much (although this was the exact same nail clipper that did cut too much when she was a smaller puppy). She was so busy eating treats that she did not even notice her nails being clipped..

# Defensive aggression
The behavior she exhibits when clipping nails is very similar to the behavior she shows when guarding something that she considers to belong to her. These behaviors have been with her from the start (maybe that's why she was one of the larger puppies in the kennel? - guarding her food from other puppies). I prefer to handle any such genetic behaviors in two ways that work in parallel:

1) let the dog do the behavior but only on command.
2) challenge the behavior and make the dog stop the behavior on command. 

The reasoning for this is very simple: to not try to shove the behavior under the carpet hoping it will never come out. To instead challenge the behavior and bring it out such that it can be studied better and also handled in the best possible way. It is important to challenge aggressive behaviors and show that the behavior is ineffective at getting what the dog wants - but it is also useful to associate a command with the behavior because it is indeed a natural behavior and so very valuable to not extinguish because it is the true nature of the animal. Also, when the behavior is challenged and the dog is rewarded for stopping the behavior after receiving a command - the dog learns that it is possible to stop the behavior and get a reward in the future.
