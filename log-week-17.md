# Week 17 (16 weeks old belgian malinois puppy)

Last week I have tried both protection, agility and a great deal of search work - as well as practicing heeling everywhere since it has started to become an annoyance when alice decides not to walk beside me. So this week will be a continuation of all that. This week we will work on developing prey drive as well as self-control. We will do more search and tracking. We may go to the agility course if there is time but for the most part we will be practicing better obedience and definitely perfecting the heeling as much as possible in one weeks time.
