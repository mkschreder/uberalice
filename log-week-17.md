# Week 17 (16 weeks old belgian malinois puppy)

Last week I have tried both protection, agility and a great deal of search work - as well as practicing heeling everywhere since it has started to become an annoyance when alice decides not to walk beside me. So this week will be a continuation of all that. This week we will work on developing prey drive as well as self-control. We will do more search and tracking. We may go to the agility course if there is time but for the most part we will be practicing better obedience and definitely perfecting the heeling as much as possible in one weeks time. 

# How much time does a Malinois need?
Looking back on these weeks since Alice was a pup the time required to maintain a dog of this breed is around 4-5 hours per day on average. Having 15-17 hours in a day, this means 11-13 hours for everything else. It is an awesome way to keep in shape, get fresh air and make time to recharge. This includes going out on short walks for the dog to do it's business outside. It is also the time required to work the dog as much as it needs to be worked in order to be tired for the rest of the time in between. After a 2 hour workout Alice sleeps for several hours solid. Nothing wakes her up. You can have loud sounds, motors, drills - she sleeps through it - because she is tired. After she wakes up, a half an hour session of obedience and then food followed by a bone keeps her occupied for another few hours. She may even sleep a while ~1.5h. After she wakes up she can usually keep herself calm and just observe surroundings for a while. Until it is time for another longer workout. Usually 1.5-2h in the morning and 1.5-2h in the evening is what keeps her calm and tired. 

It is important to be able to plan other activities around this schedule. Gradually keeping her kenneled for a longer period of time helps a lot in keeping her calm. Having chew food is very handy at keeping her occupied. When she behaves well she can hang around without being kenneled but when she misbehaves then kennel is very handy.

# Search and tracking
Rubbing a ball in the armpit and then hiding it somewhere in the woods is a fun game to practice search - although it essentially becomes tracking if you walk and hide the ball somewhere because the dog will inevitably pick up the trail you have walked. It's possible to throw the ball somewhere so that it is out of view and then command her to search. This is a lot harder though and at this stage in my training I prefer to leave a trail just to ensure eventual success for the dog. Gradually I can throw the ball further from the end of the trail or walk a random track, hiding the ball and then walking a random track within a perimeter to further confuse the tracking function and force the dog to search the area. 

Tracking is instead following a track. Naturally both search and tracking are related so both happen but it is possible to emphasize one or the other during different sessions to learn different techniques.

# Reinforcement learning in practice - bark and hold
When new commands are introduced I find that Alice is usually able to pick up the idea fairly quickly - perhaps on ~3rd to 10th attempt. The real learning happens later though. The next day she may for example lay down when told to bark. Or bark when told to sit (since the day before we would be training sit - followed by bark - followed by reward). This is where learning really happens. This is where the right behavior is gradually taught as being associated with a command and as the behavior is consistently rewarded when it is being done on queue the dog gradually learns to only do that behavior when commanded to do so. When she jumps when told to bark I find it helpful to hold her collar in position so that she can not jump. Then command her to bark and as she barks (and can not go into motion) reward her with her tug for the bark. When she is told to sit, she sits, if she barks then no reward is delivered. I also may use attention command "look" to have her watch me and this usually stops her barking. Then she gets the tug.

# No?
No is a half arsed command that only gets you half way. It is ambiguous to the dog and essentially the dog most of the time just stops what she is doing because she is confused. I find a much better approach to be the use of previously learned commands in order to command a desired behavior and in order to be able to reinforce that behavior in a particular situation. It is impossible to really reinforce 'no' because it would be ridiculous to reinforce a very recent bad behavior as well - but when another behavior that is also consistently reinforced in other situations is used then it can be reinforced in the new situation as well and show the dog an alternative way. Many times we would be tempted to use 'No' is in situations where it really means 'Wait', these are the perfect situations where to use 'wait' or 'sit' instead. Obviously there are times to use no as well - but only in the few extreme cases where no and a correction are the right thing to do. 

# Exploring cats
This week was the first opportunity to really get to know a cat up close. When doing this commands "sit" and "wait" are great. I commanded her to sit and absolutely unexpectadly the cat just walked right up to her and started smelling around. Their noses literally met and since she was so great at keeping quet, she did not scare the cat away. This was the closest cat encounter she was able to experience so far and it was great to see her so calm around the cat. The cat then walked off and sat at a few meters distance and was just staring at her. Good practice cat.

# Long distance sits
This week I have been introducing long distance commands. It happened quite naturally actually because when she would run off with the bite toy, I would naturally want to have her sit down - and it worked. Another occasion is when I am laying the track and I want her to wait for me while I do it - good time to train long distance sits. I also train long distance sit by telling her to sit and then watch me as I walk away. This week always facing her and keeping eye contact. Long distance down has not been working very well yet. They work sometimes but more often than not she just sits down instead of laying down. It's constantly raining outside so she is very reluctant to lay down for longer periods of time - which is why we should be training downs in this weather right now.

# General impulse control
The idea with impulse control is that the dog must show perfect obedience to its handler even when tempted to chase or bite something. This is something I have been practicing with this puppy since we got her at 9 weeks age. At this point however she knows the basic commands like sit and down and so it is now possible to focus more on doing this under distractions.

# Anchoring
Anchoring is basically uttering a command word when the dog is voluntarily doing something and then to praise her. This associates the command with the behavior. Later it becomes possible to use the command to get the behavior. I used this for teaching her to touch my palm with her nose to get a reward and to lick on command. Whenver she licks, I tell her 'lick' and praise her. This way I can then say 'lick' and it is less ambiguous to her what I need her to do. 

Here she is playing her game with the ball that she has invented last week - only now on a flight of stairs. The game is about taking a ball, bringing it up a stairs and then dropping it.

# Shit and pee on command
This is something that has been kind of questionable whether it works or whether she just does it because she has to. It is kind of 50/50 right now. However I like the idea of teaching her to hold it when it is not appropriate to shit. This is largely not a problem because I do not think she has ever failed to hold it until going in the woods. She always does it in the woods and the few times she almost failed I was able to pick her up and with wait command walk with her to the woods where she would go. At home she has never failed to hold her shit since the one and only time she did it right after coming home to our place from the kennel. When it comes to pissing on things it has quite a few times more but usually simply because I forgot to take her out to the woods right after we got home from a shopping trip or some other trip where there was no access to natural terrain (poor puppy).
