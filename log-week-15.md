# Week 15 (14 week old belgian malinois puppy)

This weeks focus is on jump training (not jumping up when greeting) and sitting without taking pows off the ground to grab something. I don't really have a name for these exercises but I really like both of them because they teach the dog to stay on the ground even when excited. 

# Training to sit without jumping for food
This exercise involves taking a treat and slowly moving it downwards towards the nose of the dog when the dog is sitting in front of you. If the dog tries to jump and grab the treat you lift it up and then move it down again when the dog sits back down. The dog is only supposed to be rewarded when it sits with all paws on the ground. 

# Training to not jump when greeting
This exercise involves standing up straight, calling dog towards you while keeping one hand on your chest. The dog sees the hand and will naturally try to jump on you. You then wait until dog sits down in front of you and then reward the dog with the other hand such that it learns that hand up towards chest does not have treats. This is usually what people would do when a dog comes up against them so teaching it like this is a good way to teach the dog not to jump up on people. Also if there are other behaviors that people do (besides patting the dog) when it comes towards it, train the same exercise while emulating such behaviors as well. Rewards are given with the other hand by lowballing them to the dog so that the dog is not enticed to jump to get the treat.
