# Week 15 (14 week old belgian malinois puppy)

This weeks focus is on jump training (not jumping up when greeting) and sitting without taking pows off the ground to grab something. I don't really have a name for these exercises but I really like both of them because they teach the dog to stay on the ground even when excited. 

Also this week I'm focusing on distractions which are irritating to the dog. Examples include: large outdoors brush, vacuum cleaner, baloons (because they pop). Anything we can find. These things need to be associated with something positive such as treats or praise. 

# Training to sit without jumping for food
This exercise involves taking a treat and slowly moving it downwards towards the nose of the dog when the dog is sitting in front of you. If the dog tries to jump and grab the treat you lift it up and then move it down again when the dog sits back down. The dog is only supposed to be rewarded when it sits with all paws on the ground. 

# Training to not jump when greeting
This exercise involves standing up straight, calling dog towards you while keeping one hand on your chest. The dog sees the hand and will naturally try to jump on you. You then wait until dog sits down in front of you and then reward the dog with the other hand such that it learns that hand up towards chest does not have treats. This is usually what people would do when a dog comes up against them so teaching it like this is a good way to teach the dog not to jump up on people. Also if there are other behaviors that people do (besides patting the dog) when it comes towards it, train the same exercise while emulating such behaviors as well. Rewards are given with the other hand by lowballing them to the dog so that the dog is not enticed to jump to get the treat. 

# Continued training of wait, stay and attention (look me in the eyes)
This week we have been consistently getting better at stay and wait. I can now walk away at least 5m and Alice does not move towards me but waits for her treat while looking at me. I have achieved this mainly through extending the time between giving her treats and I have also started using popping sound with my mouth very consistently whenever she does something right. This is the same as using clicked but who has a clicker with them everywhere they go?? WHy use clicker when you have a mouth with a tongue inside it? So this has really helped accelerating the progress. 

Also I have now been consistently getting her to wait with taking food until getting a command. I have tested the fact that she actually understands the words by saying random words with the same intonation and she was able to resist taking the chicken until given the comand to go for it. At which point she eagerly ate the chicken placed right in front of her. 

# Potty training
The potty training has been going very well now. She is now going only once per night (between 23:30 and 1:30) and then sleeps through the night until around 6-7 oclock the next morning - at which point I take her out and she can pee 2-3 times. This is good - she understands that she has to hold it in. During the day the amount of time is still max 3-4 hours. She barks and runs around when she has to go so this is very clear and easy to see. She is able to adjust how much she drinks and eats in the evening to avoid going potting. Very good.

# Deer bones as a tooth brush
After each meal Alice likes to chew on her deer bones. Specially now at 14 weeks the puppy teeth are starting to fall out. Two top ones have already given way and one of the canines (the one she broke during playing tug at 11 weeks - happy it has finally fallen out without any infections). This period is made easier by the raw bones she gets to exercise her teeth with.
