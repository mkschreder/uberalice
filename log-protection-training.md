# Protection training log

It is important to point out that protection training takes place all the time in the sense that the foundation of confidence must be built every single day. The official protection sessions are used to "hammer in the nail" and get all of the techniques learned outside of the official sessions to stick properly. Official sessions are unpredictable and intense. They are designed to push the dog to the next level. This is done with a good decoy - yet the handler must be highly engaged in the training as well because it is the handler's job to train the dog - not the decoy's. 

|Session|Age|Description|
|------|-----|------|
|1|15 weeks|First introduction. I hold puppy in my hands, decoy approaches while simulataneously backing away. Two steps forward, one step back. Decoy tries to approach the dog. The goal is to get the dog to growl and possibly bark. Important not to let the dog be scared away and back off. The puppy is small enough to hold in my hands. Massive food reward and touch reward after successful training. |
|2|15 weeks|Same day, same exercise. |
|3|17 weeks|No longer possible to keep the puppy in my hands. She is now able to stand her ground and bark deeply at the decoy as the decoy approaches, cracks his whip and then runs away into the bushes. She is constant in her gaze while observing the decoy. Occasional barks and growls when the decoy is far away. |
|4|17 weeks|Same exercise. The decoy now cracks his whip more and comes even closer.|
|5|17 weeks|Longer session with barking, standing ground and showing confidence.|
|6|17 weeks|Really good group exercise with several dogs where all dogs (both experineced and puppies) are barking at the decoy as the decoy approaches into the middle of the circle, cracks his whip and provokes the dogs.|
|7|4 months|Decoy approaches really close. Dog wants to get him. Leash is shortened and then released so the dog can get at the decoy while the decoy jumps away.|
|8|4 months|Decoy teases the dog with a soft bite toy. The dog is not allowed to grab at first but continues to be provoked and then gets the chance to grab the toy and run with it around in a circle.
